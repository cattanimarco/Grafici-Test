# Grafici-Test

This repository is intended to test (and abuse) the Grafici-GFX plotting library for Arduino without the need of hardware. 

This is achieved by creating a Adafruit_GFX derived class (File_GFX) that print to a bitmap file rather than to a display. Stub code has been added where needed.

The idea behind Grafici-Test is to speed up the development of the Grafici-GFX library but also to produce "screenshots" of the  library's plots. Screenshot are both useful for documentation and for the enjoyment of the mind.
