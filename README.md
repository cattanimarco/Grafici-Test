# Grafici-Test

This repository is intended to test (and abuse) the Grafici-GFX plotting library for Arduino without the need of hardware. 
This is achieved by creating a Adafruit_GFX derived class that print to a bitmap file rather than to a display.
This is useful for speed up the development of the library but also to produce "screenshot" of the library plots that are useful for documentation.
